### **AWS Serverless Components**
1. **What is AWS Serverless?**
   - AWS Serverless is a cloud computing model that allows you to run applications without managing infrastructure. It automatically scales and manages resources based on demand.
---
2. **What are the benefits of using serverless computing?**
   - No need to manage servers, automatic scaling, cost-efficient (pay only for usage), reduced operational overhead, and easy deployment.
---
3. **What are the main AWS services used in serverless architectures?**
   - AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, AWS Step Functions, AWS SNS, AWS SQS, and AWS Cognito.
---
4. **How does AWS Lambda work in a serverless environment?**
   - AWS Lambda allows you to run your code in response to events, without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales depending on the incoming requests.
---
5. **What is Amazon API Gateway, and how is it used with AWS Lambda?**

---
26. **How do you monitor AWS Lambda functions?**
    - AWS Lambda functions can be monitored using Amazon CloudWatch, which provides logs, metrics (e.g., invocation counts, duration, error rates), and alarms.
---
27. **What is a Lambda destination?**
    - Lambda destinations allow you to send the result of a Lambda function invocation to another service, such as SNS, SQS, or a Lambda function itself, upon completion.
---
28. **What is the AWS Lambda concurrency limit?**
    - By default, AWS Lambda has a concurrency limit of 1,000 concurrent executions per region, which can be increased upon request.
---
29. **How can you reduce cold start latency in Lambda functions?**
    - Cold start latency can be minimized by optimizing function code, keeping the function warm using scheduled invocations, and minimizing function size.
---
